            This band is important to me because I snuck out of my house in East Amherst, NY when I was 16 to go see them play at the Town Ballroom in Downtown Buffalo. They sucked, played too fast and everyone there was angry. But it was a lot of fun and I still talk about it with my friends to this day.  Re-listening to former favorites like 'LAX'? Little bit cringy. But 'Shining On' totally holds up.

            blink182 standardized a brand of pop infused 'punk' that was digestable by suburban teens in the early 2000s. This brand of pop-punk was less vitriolic than its punk forefathers, but it did express a vanilla brand of discontent that had enough conviction to satiate teen angst without sacrificing an element crucial to getting through things: a sense of humor. See album: Take Off Your Pants and Jacket for reference. While blink182 was already disbanded by the time I cut my teeth on the emo-pop-punk of the late 2000s, their influence was clear and their hurried riffs and simple lyrics resonated with me deeply.

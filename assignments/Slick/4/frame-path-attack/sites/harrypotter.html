            Alright, alright. I get it. Cliche and obvious influence for 90s babies. That out of the way, Harry Potter is awesome and you'll take those books away only from my cold, dead millenial hands. How frequently in the age of the internet are kids lined up outside Barnes and Noble at midnight for the release of a book? Harry Potter, always.

            Consistent with my taste palette that includes blink182, the influence of the Jackass movies on my psyche is stronger than I care to admit. Riddled with a heavy dose of optimistic nihilism, there is undoubtedly a vestige of wisdom in the commitment 'if you're gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough'.  Of all the Jackass crew, Knoxville was the dude. Absolutely devoid of any qualifiable skillset, he was fearless throwing himself at bulls and lighting fireworks out of his hind parts. The message of this tomfoolery? F*** it. You're already naked and dying, do what you like and laugh it off. Honestly, is there anything cooler than this?
